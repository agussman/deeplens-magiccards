Generate a SageMaker object classification / detection model in SageMaker.

It's really confusing where to begin.

# Tips and Troubleshooting

If you need to change your WiFi network, you'll need to use a pin to hit the "Reset" button on the back. This will re-activate the DeepLens' WiFi network. You can then reconnect to it and add the new network (it will remember previous networks).
